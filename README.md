Projects from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program

## Analyze A/B Test Results
Utilizing Pandas and Numpy, this project is about understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Wrangle and Analyze Data
The dataset that I used (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. 

I gathered, cleaned, assessed, analyzed the visualized the data.

## Spotify Data Analysis
I chose two datasets from kaggle, here're the links:
First data set: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks 
Second data set: https://www.kaggle.com/iamsumat/spotify-top-2000s-mega-dataset

The first data set focuses on the musical features, such as keys, danceability and energy, of 160k+ tracks released throughtout the last century. The second dataset zooms in on the releases from the 2000s, but with categorical data of the songs' genres.

Both datasets are clean so no data wrangling steps are taken.

We found that loudness, energy and release date play the most important roles in the songs' popularity. We also dived deeper in the correlation among these variables.
